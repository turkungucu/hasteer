            Referral Points are our way of thanking you for bringing people into
            a deal and help achieve the best price. Points never expire, and they
            can be redeemed for actual cash value while shopping on Hasteer.com.

            You must first login to your Hasteer account (via Facebook or otherwise)
            for us to be able to track your referrals. On each Product page, you
            will notice the number of points that can be earned and several
            sharing options.

            Facebook Like button is the simplest way of posting a link to a deal
            on your wall. The more comprehensive Share button will allow you to
            utilize plain email, Facebook Share, Twitter and many more social
            sharing/bookmarking sites.

            You will earn points when the followers of your link purchase 
            the product. In other words, they need to join the deal and the 
            deal has to complete. Points never expire and they post to your 
            account immediately after deal is processed.
