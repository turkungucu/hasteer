    <div class="faq-answer">
        No, we don't charge your credit card when you join a deal. However, 
        we'll authorize it for the deal amount. As soon as deal closes, your
        credit card will be charged. At this time you cannot make any more
        changes to the deal. You will also receive an email notifying you that
        your credit card is charged.

    <div class="faq-answer">
        When joining a deal, we ask users to select the <i>maximum</i> amount 
        they are willing to pay. You always get the deal at the closing price as
        long as it equals to or less than <i>maximum</i> amount selected.
